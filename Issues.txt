Issues:
    - Copying old hex files into modified editor doesn't compile (telling teachers to do this wont work)
    - Github autoupdate translations.json doesn't look for version number changes (if temp_trans < trans should be <=)
    - A few "gather" hex files use 360000ms, which is 6 minutes
    - Odd one off error when there was no hub traffic, Data = 99e rt = 129
